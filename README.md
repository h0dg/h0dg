## Featured Project

### Energy Data Aggregation Pipeline
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/h0dg/eia-pipeline)  

Built an incremental ETL pipeline in Python to ingest, clean, and aggregate U.S. electricity generation data from the EIA Open Data API.  

**Key Features:**
- Modular Python scripts with unit tests (pytest), logging, and error handling
- Raw & clean SQLite databases with mapping tables for states, fuels, and units
- CLI interface for end-to-end execution
- Produces clean, analysis-ready datasets and visualizations

This project demonstrates software engineering practices, reproducible workflows, and system-level thinking.
